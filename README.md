Once done, please commit and push your changes into github.

If you saved as the root index.html file, you will be able to view the file at the url: `http://syrys-jwt.github.io/forcenetworktpm/`, similarly, if you add it in a different folder, type the folder name at the end of the url followed by the file name.

## Publishing to website
If you want to include/embed the published html file into a wordpress site/page, please login to wordpress, create/find the page you want to embed this to, then click the editor into "Text" mode (sometime this is called the "code" mode, usually visible somehwree at the top right of the wysiwyg editor). Once in the code/text mode, insert the following bit of code:
````
<iframe style="width: 100%; display: block;" src="http://syrys-jwt.github.io/forcenetworktpm/" height="600px"></iframe>
````
Please Note: please change the link above to the appropriate link to your html file, and set a height of the embed element in pixels.
